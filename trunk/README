bgmapeditor (or mapeditor for short) is an opensource editor for boardgames such as Zombicide, Space Hulk and other dungeon crawlers and games with modular boards.

Although more than 13 years old, bgmapeditor is still used to create novel scenarios. Feel free to download it and to modify whatever you want.

Enjoy!
